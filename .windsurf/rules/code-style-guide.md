# Code Style Guide

- Prioritize clarity, simplicity, and maintainability in all code.
- Follow idiomatic Ruby and Rails conventions.
- Use descriptive, consistent naming for files, classes, methods, and variables.
- Write code for humans firstâ€”favor readability over cleverness.
- Keep functions and classes focused on single responsibilities.
- Add code comments only for non-obvious logic.
- Use commit messages that are concise and descriptive (see user rules for format).
